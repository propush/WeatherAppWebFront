# Weather App

This is a simple weather widget app with backend and user authentication & authorization.
The main purpose was to learn how to use React and learn modern Typescript.
All user data like list of weather locations is stored at backend.

For deployment use .env file with following variables:

```VITE_API_BASE_URL``` - base url for backend api.

See .env.sample for example.

## Backend
Backend can be found at https://github.com/propush/WeatherAppWebBack

## Example

The sample running (I hope so at least) installation can be found at https://weather.pumpmy.it
(sign up with any user, no additional confirmation required, no user data collected).
